IdeaForge is an open-source collaborative suite that brings artists, writers, filmmakers, animators, game designers, musicians, and creative professionals together in real-time. Think Figma meets Notion, purpose-built for creative workflows.

## üöÄ Our Vision: A New Era of Collaborative Creation

Too often, creative projects stall‚Äînot because of a lack of ideas, but because creators don‚Äôt have access to the right collaborators. A screenwriter might imagine a character‚Äôs story, but need an artist to visualize them or a musician to bring a scene to life. What if the world‚Äôs creative talent could come together‚Äîacross disciplines, geographies, and skill levels‚Äîto build something bigger than themselves?

**IdeaForge is more than just a tool. It‚Äôs a new creative ecosystem:**

- **Open Collaboration:** Writers, artists, musicians, filmmakers, animators, and more can post their work, invite others to contribute, and watch their ideas evolve in real time.
- **Flexible Rights & Revenue:** Creators choose how their work is used:
  - Allow and receive royalties on derivative works
  - Sell royalty rights up front
  - Or gift their work to the public domain
- **All-in-One Platform:** No more scattered portfolios or chasing collaborators. Share, adapt, remix, and get paid‚Äîall in one place.
- **Power for Everyone:** Whether you‚Äôre a stay-at-home artist, a hobbyist, or a pro, you can contribute, build your portfolio, and earn from anywhere.
- **Creative ‚ÄúMultiverse‚Äù:** One script or story can become dozens of artworks, animations, games, or even VR experiences‚Äîeach credited, each rewarding its contributors.

**We believe in a world where:**

- Creative barriers are broken down
- Credit and revenue flow fairly
- Anyone can help bring great stories to life‚Äînot just big studios

Join us to help build the future of collaborative creation.  
Let‚Äôs make creativity accessible, rewarding, and truly global.
