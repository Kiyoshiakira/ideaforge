# IdeaForge

**Where Art Meets Collaboration**

IdeaForge is an open, collaborative creative suite designed for artists, writers, filmmakers, animators, game designers, and anyone with a passion for storytelling. Our goal is to provide a real-time, role-based platform for teams to create, manage, and showcase projects—whether it's a script, animation, game, or multimedia production.
