# IdeaForge Next Steps: Collaborative Creative Suite Development

This document outlines the next steps and key considerations for building the collaborative project suite for IdeaForge. We’ll approach this as a modular, extensible system—with careful attention to user roles, skillsets, onboarding, and AI integration.

---

## 1. Project Foundations

- [ ] **Define Core Use Cases & Personas**
  - Filmmakers, game designers, animators, writers, musicians, etc.
  - What workflows do they need? (Scriptwriting, storyboarding, asset tracking, world/character building, etc.)

- [ ] **Draft High-Level System Architecture**
  - Modular “project” structure with plug-in panels (script, board, characters, etc.)
  - Real-time collaboration tech (Yjs/Automerge)
  - Backend for user/project management, file storage, permissions

---

## 2. User Roles & Skillsets

- [ ] **Role System**
  - Project Owner (full control, save, revert, manage members)
  - Collaborator (edit, suggest, non-destructive)
  - Viewer (read-only)
  - AI Bot (assistant/initiator)

- [ ] **Skillset Verification**
  - Let users list skills (art, writing, animation, sound, etc.)
  - “Confirm” skills via portfolio, test, or reputation (future)
  - Skill tags visible to project owners for smart invites

---

## 3. Collaboration & Security

- [ ] **Real-Time Editing**
  - Multi-user editing of text, boards, etc.
  - Presence indicators and active user list

- [ ] **Grief Protection**
  - Only owner can save/revert or remove users
  - Change log/history, possibly with moderation tools

- [ ] **Join & Onboarding**
  - Easy joining via invite or open projects
  - Onboarding UI for new users, including demo/practice mode

---

## 4. AI Integration

- [ ] **AI Project Bot**
  - Can start demo projects for new users
  - Can fill out missing roles or suggest improvements
  - Provides onboarding guidance, tips, and “practice” feedback

- [ ] **Adaptive AI**
  - Adjusts onboarding, tooltips, and difficulty based on user skillset
  - Recommends relevant docs, panels, or tutorials as users explore

---

## 5. User Showcases & Portfolios

- [ ] **User Profile Pages**
  - Each user should have a dedicated page showing:
    - Bio & avatar
    - Skillset/tags
    - Portfolio: uploads, links to works, media (video/audio/images)
    - Projects owned (with links/descriptions)
    - Projects participated in (with roles)
    - Links to socials/external portfolios

- [ ] **Showcase Page**
  - Global gallery for featured or public works from all users
  - Categories (animation, music, writing, etc.) and filters
  - Clicking a work or creator opens their profile/portfolio
  - Optionally: user can select works to display in both their profile and the public showcase

---

## 6. Funding & Community Support

- [ ] **Funding Strategies**
  - Research and list potential funding sources:
    - Grants (arts, creative technology, open source, etc.)
    - Crowdfunding (Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, Open Collective, Patreon)
    - Sponsorships and partnerships (creative industry orgs, tech companies)
    - Angel/seed investors (if aiming for a commercial product)
    - Premium features/paid plans for sustainability

- [ ] **Action Steps for Funding**
  - Draft a compelling project pitch and roadmap
  - Prepare a basic budget estimate (hosting, development, design, ongoing support)
  - Identify and apply for relevant grants or funding programs
  - Set up a crowdfunding campaign (if desired)
  - Build a landing page or presentation for potential partners and backers

- [ ] **Community Building & Recruitment**
  - Create clear calls-to-action for contributors (developers, designers, artists, testers)
  - Offer recognition, credits, or possible bounties for key help
  - Reach out to relevant online communities, forums, and social media
  - Document contribution guidelines and onboarding for new helpers

## 7. MVP: Step-by-Step Build Plan

1. **System Foundations**
   - [ ] Set up repo, base backend, and frontend scaffold
   - [ ] User authentication & profile (including skill tags)
   - [ ] Project creation, joining, and role assignment

2. **Collaboration Core**
   - [ ] Implement real-time shared editing (MVP: script or notes)
   - [ ] Basic permissions: owner/collaborator/viewer
   - [ ] Owner-only save/revert/rollback

3. **Skill & Onboarding Layer**
   - [ ] UI for skill display and confirmation
   - [ ] Smart invite/join UI

4. **AI Bot Integration**
   - [ ] Simple AI bot for onboarding/practice projects
   - [ ] Contextual help and adaptive onboarding

5. **User Showcase & Portfolio**
   - [ ] User profile pages with works, skillset, project lists
   - [ ] Global showcase page with featured/public works

6. **Funding & Community**
   - [ ] Launch landing page for funding/crowdfunding
   - [ ] Announce project and recruit contributors

7. **Expand Features**
   - [ ] Add modules (character, world, boards, etc.)
   - [ ] Enhanced AI, moderation, export/import, etc.

## 8. Open Questions

- How to verify skills? Portfolio links, skill tests, reputation, peer reviews?
- What should the AI bot’s first capabilities be? (Onboarding, generating ideas, project setup, etc.)
- What tech stack will best support fast iteration and future expansion?
- What features are essential for the first MVP vs. can come later?
- Should user profile/portfolio pages be public, private, or user-selectable?
- Should users opt-in to be featured in the public showcase, or is it admin/owner curated?
- Which funding sources best match the project’s values and goals?
- What incentives can be offered to attract early contributors and collaborators?

**Let’s proceed step by step, starting with project and user system foundations, while exploring funding and recruiting help.**
