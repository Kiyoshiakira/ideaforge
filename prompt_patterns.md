## üìö Foundations: What Is Creative Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering is the art and science of designing effective instructions for AI models to generate creative outputs‚Äîstories, scripts, characters, art directions, music, and more. This guide is model-agnostic and works with GPT-family models, Claude, Llama, and others.

**Inspiration from:**  
- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/) (structured templates, chaining)
- [Promptify](https://github.com/promptslab/Promptify) (task-focused, reusable)
- [OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)

## üìù Best Practices for Creative Prompt Engineering

1. **Specificity Without Over-Constraint**
   - Give clear goals but leave space for creative interpretation.
   - Show examples, not just abstract instructions.
   - Guide structure, but don‚Äôt stifle creativity.

2. **Context Setting**
   - State genre, audience, and medium at the start.
   - Include background and desired style/tone.

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Begin broad, then narrow with follow-ups.
   - Request multiple options before picking.
   - Use stepwise development (prompt chaining).

4. **Output Structure**
   - Request organized, scannable responses (bullets, sections).
   - Ask for reasoning behind creative choices.
   - Include ‚Äúwhat next?‚Äù guidance.

5. **Creative Constraints**
   - Use limits (length, theme, tools) to drive innovation.
   - Mix unexpected elements for originality.
   - Encourage challenging norms for new solutions.
