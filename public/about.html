        <h1>About IdeaForge</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>IdeaForge is where art meets collaboration.</strong> We are an open, global platform for creators of
          all backgrounds—artists, writers, filmmakers, musicians, game designers, animators, and dreamers—to work
          together, share ideas, and bring creative visions to life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to make creativity accessible, collaborative, and rewarding for everyone. Whether you're a
          professional, a hobbyist, or just starting out, IdeaForge is your creative home.

        <h2>🚀 Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Creative projects often stall not for lack of ideas, but for lack of the right collaborators.</strong>
          Maybe you’re a writer who can picture a world, but can’t draw the landscapes. Maybe you’re a musician who
          wants to score a film, or an artist who dreams of seeing your characters animated. What if you could connect
          with the right partners, anywhere in the world, and build something bigger—together?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>IdeaForge is more than a tool. It’s a new creative ecosystem.</strong> Post your work, invite others
          to adapt or remix it, set your own terms for credit and royalties, and watch projects become a multiverse of
          creative possibilities.
